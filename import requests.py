I am writing a protocol paper for Ga protein pulldown assay: I need to write down step by step list of each procedure. Can you expand the following description of the original paper as much as possible?  BL21 E.coli cells were transformed with constructs expressing GST-tagged GINIP protein or GST-tagged GRK2 N-terminal domain.  Cells were incubated in terrific broth (http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2015/9/pdb.rec085894.full) and protein expression induced by addition of 0.5µg/ml IPTG.  Cells were collected after 8 hours, lysed and GST- proteins collected on Glutathione-conjugated beads. Beads were washed 4 times, eluted with 50mM glutathione and proteins desalted on a gel filtration column. Aliquots of 20 µg aliquots were stored frozen and thawed shortly before use. 

For pulldown assays, HUVECs infected with lentivirus encoding GluGlu-tagged Gi mutant or lentivirus encoding both GluGlu-tagged Gq mutant and Ric8A were lysed in cell lysis buffer composed of 10mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5mM DTT and additional 2µg/ml of GST-GINIP or GST-GRK2N, and the lysates were incubated for 10 minutes at 4˚C with gentle agitation with glutathione beads.  Beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer, isolated proteins were solubilized in SDS sample laemmli buffer, and were analyzed by western blotting.

Certainly! To expand on the description of a Ga protein pulldown assay, let's delve into each step to provide a comprehensive protocol. Remember that such assays involve multiple stages including preparation, execution, and analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown:

Ga Protein Pulldown Assay Protocol
Materials Required
Cell lysates
Ga protein beads (e.g., agarose or magnetic)
Lysis buffer
Non-ionic detergent (e.g., NP-40 or Triton X-100)
Protease inhibitors
Binding buffer
Maintains optimal conditions for protein interaction
Wash buffer
Similar composition to lysis buffer
Elution buffer
Typically contains higher salt concentration or different pH to dissociate complex
SDS-PAGE gels
Western blot reagents
Equipment Needed
Centrifuge
Rotating mixer
**Magnetic stand

Procedure
1. Transformation and Protein Expression
Transformation:

Transform BL21 E. coli cells with the constructs expressing either GST-tagged GINIP or GST-tagged GRK2 N-terminal domain.
Follow standard transformation protocols to ensure high-efficiency uptake of the plasmid DNA into the E. coli cells.
Cultivation:

Inoculate the transformed E. coli in terrific broth, using the protocol referenced here. Ensure optimal conditions for bacterial growth.
Grow the cultures until they reach an appropriate optical density (OD600), typically around 0.6 to 0.8.
Induction:

Induce protein expression by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 µg/ml.
Incubate the cultures for an additional 8 hours at the appropriate temperature (usually 30°C to reduce protein aggregation).
2. Protein Collection and Purification
Harvesting Cells:

After induction, collect the cells by centrifugation at 4°C. Typically, spin at 5000 x g for 10 minutes.
Cell Lysis:

Resuspend the cell pellet in an appropriate volume of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors.
Lyse the cells using sonication or another preferred method while maintaining the temperature at 4°C to prevent protein degradation.
Protein Capture:

Add the lysate to glutathione-conjugated beads pre-washed with lysis buffer.
Incubate the mixture at 4°C with gentle agitation for optimal binding of GST-tagged proteins to the beads.
Washing and Elution:

Wash the beads four times with lysis buffer to remove non-specifically bound proteins.
Elute the bound GST-proteins using 50 mM glutathione buffer.
Desalting:

Desalt the eluted proteins on a gel filtration column to remove excess glutathione and buffer exchange.
Storage:

Aliquot proteins into 20 µg quantities and store at -80°C. Thaw aliquots just before use.
3. Pulldown Assays
Lysis of HUVECs:

Infect HUVECs with lentivirus encoding GluGlu-tagged Gi mutant or both GluGlu-tagged Gq mutant and Ric8A.
Prepare a lysis buffer composed of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT, and supplement with 2 µg/ml of purified GST-GINIP or GST-GRK2N protein.
Lyse the infected HUVECs in this buffer.
Incubation with Beads:

Add the prepared lysates to pre-equilibrated glutathione beads.
Incubate for 10 minutes at 4°C with gentle agitation to promote interaction between target proteins and immobilized GST-fusion proteins.
Bead Washing:

Wash the beads three times with the lysis buffer to remove unbound proteins.
Solubilization and Analysis:

Solubilize the isolated proteins from the beads using SDS sample Laemmli buffer.
Analyze the proteins through western blotting to check for the presence and interaction of the target proteins.
Note:
Always maintain cold temperatures during the lysis and washing steps to preserve protein integrity.
Use appropriate controls and repeat experiments to ensure reproducibility and accuracy of results.
